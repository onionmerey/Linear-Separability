%
% SYNOPSIS: 
%   This code snippet demonstrates how to use the LS_Testing() function 
%   to test Linearly Separable (LS) or Non-Linearly Separable (NLS) data sets. 
%   The data can either be generated using custom functions or read from a CSV file.

%   Testing Linear Separability between Two Sets', TPAMI 2024.
