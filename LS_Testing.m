% LS_Testing Function
%==========================================================================
%
% SYNOPSIS: 
%   This function qualitatively determines whether the point sets A and B are linearly separable (LS),
%   and quantifies their LS degree.
%
% INPUTS:
%   A       - Point set A as an N x M1 matrix, where N is the number of dimensions and M1 is the number of points. 
%             Points are represented as column vectors.
%   B       - Point set B as an N x M2 matrix, where N is the number of dimensions and M2 is the number of points. 
%             Points are represented as column vectors.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   LS          - Linear Separability Indicator (0 or 1)
%   LS_Degree   - Degree of linear separability. The value ranges between 0
%                 and 1, where 0 indicates NLS, and the higher the value, the
%                 more linearly separable it is. 
%   time        - Time taken to execute the function
%
%
% EXAMPLE USAGE:
%   [LS, LS_Degree, time] = LS_Testing(A, B)
%
% SEE ALSO:
%   - LARGEupdateS
%   - LARGElineSearch
%   - LARGEfacetIntersection
% 
% NOTES:
%   - The function uses GPU for speeding up the computation and employs adaptive block computation 
%     based on the available GPU memory. Block size may affect the running time, and can be adjusted 
%     according to specific requirements.
% 
%   - When the system has limited GPU memory and the task is large, it may result in abnormal 
%     blocksize and errors. You can increase the GPU utilization ratio or use a GPU with larger memory.
% 
%   - The code is used on a relatively newer version of MATLAB (the experiments in the paper were 
%     conducted using MATLAB 2023b). If the MATLAB version is too old, it may result in errors.
% 
%   - The approach for constructing the minimum covering ball in this code is based on Cavaleiro, Marta, and Farid Alizadeh.
%     "A faster dual algorithm for the Euclidean minimum covering ball problem." Annals of operations research (2018): 1-13..
%     We are very grateful to them for their contributions to the theoretical aspects of the algorithm!
% 
%   - This code is implemented solely to verify the feasibility of the algorithm presented in the paper. 
%     There are many aspects where efficiency can be further optimized. Your corrections and suggestions are most welcome!
